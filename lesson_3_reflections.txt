When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repository helps keep the repository online as keeping all your work local might be dangerous as we risk losing data in case of unforeseen incidents.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Github cannot update the changes that I have made to the files locally. So, to update the repository with all the changes you have, you must pull the repository, add the changes, commit them and then puh them back.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a feature provided by Github to clone existing repository of another user who does not allow other's contribution to his original project.  
    Clones are a copy of repositories that are available online that get downloaded to your local machine via the command git clone <url>.
    Branches are divisions in a repository made to work on a new feature or idea for a project without hampering the original working code. This feature is enabled by using th command git branch <name-of-branch>.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Saving a copy of the last known remote allows the user to keep track of all the changes that were made in the period of time he/she was offline. This will enable him to get on track easily.
