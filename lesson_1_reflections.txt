How did viewing a difference between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I was able to analyze the difference between both the codes line by line and thus was able to get to
my conclusions as to which line has to changed and in what respect.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
 Viewing other versions of a file can help me understand the changes made in them and
 their significance. This helps in understanding the use of different commands or file data.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Cool because makes me feel like the King.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
 in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 Probably because Google Docs is not a coding platform while Git is specifically made
 compare code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
The log command allows you to see the list of all changes that have been made
and the diff feature enables the user to look into a file to see all the alterations
that were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break
something?
Dunno But its kinda cool.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To do some cool stuff and make a chatbot.
